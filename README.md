## problem / solution

If you're copy-pasting code from Bootstrap and encountering a linting warning related to the style prop in React, it's possible that there's a discrepancy between the expected format of the style prop in React and the format of the Bootstrap code you're pasting.
instead of this
<div style="color: red; font-size: 16px;">Hello, Bootstrap!</div>
do this
<div style={{ color: 'red', fontSize: '16px' }}>Hello, React!</div>
